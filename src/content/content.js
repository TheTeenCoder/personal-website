  Hi! I'm Mark Fang. I am currently a student living in St. Louis in middle school. 
  If you don't see me coding, napping, or writing, you can usually see me shooting 
  some hoops in the driveway. If you happen to see me in St. Louis, say hi to me. Don't worry, I don't bite!

export const PROJECTS_INTRO = `
  I am an avid coder. I love to create websites, command line interfaces, and other awesome 
  sh*t. I'm not always a couch potato, here are some of my projects I created. 
`

export const PROJECT_1 = `
  I go to mandarin language school on Sundays. I noticed that their COVID check-in system is super slow.
  So I created a website that helps our school check-in faster with custom QR codes. 
`

export const PROJECT_2 = `
  The website you are viewing right now is one of my projects! My personal website is created with 
  React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
`

export const PROJECT_3 = `
  I created a CRUD website sort of like linktr.ee, where you can introduce yourself with a link. Disclaimer: 
  The Project is not in production yet.
